Great! Now that you've downloaded the **binary distribution** of Kafka (version `3.9.0`), the setup is much easier since you don't need to build the project from source. Here's how you can set it up and start Kafka on Windows:

### 1. **Extract Kafka Binary Distribution**
- You've already downloaded and extracted the Kafka binary to `C:\kafka_2.12-3.9.0`, so you can move on to the next steps.

### 2. **Start Zookeeper**
Kafka still requires **Zookeeper** for managing cluster metadata. The binary distribution includes a pre-configured Zookeeper, so you just need to run it.

#### Steps to start Zookeeper:
1. Open **Command Prompt** and navigate to the Kafka folder:
   ```bash
   cd C:\kafka_2.12-3.9.0
   ```
2. Run the following command to start **Zookeeper**:
   ```bash
   .\bin\windows\zookeeper-server-start.bat .\config\zookeeper.properties
   ```

   This will start the Zookeeper server on your local machine.

### 3. **Start Kafka Server**
Once Zookeeper is running, you can start the Kafka broker (server) to handle Kafka topics and message queues.

#### Steps to start Kafka:
1. Open another **Command Prompt** window and navigate to the Kafka folder:
   ```bash
   cd C:\kafka_2.12-3.9.0
   ```
2. Run the following command to start the **Kafka server**:
   ```bash
   .\bin\windows\kafka-server-start.bat .\config\server.properties
   ```

   This will start the Kafka broker on **localhost:9092**.

### 4. **Verify Kafka Setup**
- To verify that Kafka is working, you can create a topic and send a test message using the **Kafka console tools**.

#### Create a Kafka Topic:
Open another **Command Prompt** window and run the following command to create a topic:
   ```bash
   .\bin\windows\kafka-topics.bat --create --topic test-topic --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1
   ```

#### Send a Message to the Topic:
Use the Kafka **Producer** console to send a message:
   ```bash
   .\bin\windows\kafka-console-producer.bat --broker-list localhost:9092 --topic test-topic
   ```
After running the above command, type a message and hit **Enter** to send it.

#### Read the Message from the Topic:
Open another **Command Prompt** window and run the following command to consume the message from the topic:
   ```bash
   .\bin\windows\kafka-console-consumer.bat --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --topic test-topic --from-beginning
   ```

You should see the message you sent via the producer.
